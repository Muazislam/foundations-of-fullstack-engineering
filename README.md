# Foundations of Full Stack Engineering

This respository provides a structured documentation and reference foundation for fullstack web engineering. It consolidates core concepts across the frontend and backend layers, emphasizing standards compliance, architectural clarity, and reproducible engineering practices.

This respository is documentation-first by design treating technical writing and conceptual rigor as first-class engineering artifacts alongside code.

## Scope

The scope of this respository includes:
- Frontend foundations (HTML, CSS, Client-side architecture)
- Backend conceptual foundations (to be expanded)
- Cross-cutting engineering concerns such as accessibility, security, and performance.
- Standards-based references and traceable technical sources.

This content is intentionally organized to scale as additional technologies and system layers are introduced.

## Documentation philosophy

The documentation prioritizes:
- Semantic correctness over syntactic memorization
- Alignment with authoritative standards (e.g., W3C, WHATWG)
- Clear separation of concerns between system layers
- Neutral, technical, and reproducible explanations

Tutorial-style guidance and opinionated workflows are delibrately avoided.

## Respository Structure

- `/docs` - Conceptual and technical documentation organized by system layer
- `/examples` - Minimal, standards-compliant reference implementations
- `/references` - External authoritative sources and specifications

## Intended Audience

- Computer Science and software engineering students
- Aspiring full stack engineers
- Developers seeking a structured, standards-oriented reference

## Status

This respository is under active development and will evolve incrementally as additional layers of the full stack are documented.
